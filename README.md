## Hi there 👋 I'm Jiawen Zhang, a  graduate student at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.

- 🎓 I'm pursuing a Master's Degree in 💻Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.

- 🏢 Previously, I interned as a Software Developer at SAP in China, where I participated in the development and maintenance of [SAP Work Zone](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/workzone.html), a cloud-based digital workplace that helps employees in an organization communicate and collaborate better.

- 📜 During my undergraduate studies, I worked on research projects related to deep learning in medicine and published a paper titled ["MNL-Network: A Multi-scale Non-local Network for Epilepsy Detection from EEG Signals"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00870/full).

- 💻 My technical interests include distributed systems, networked systems, and artificial intelligence.
