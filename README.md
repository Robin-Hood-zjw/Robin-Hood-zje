## Hi there 👋 I'm Le Yang, a Computer Science graduate student at UC San Diego.

- 🎓 I'm pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science with a focus on Distributed Systems and Artificial Intelligence.

- 💻 I have strong skills in software development and machine learning.

- 💼 Last summer, I interned as a Backend Developer at NeuralX, Inc in Los Angeles, where I worked on class auto-generation and auto-assignment of [Presence.fit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/presence-fit/id1494435397), an AI-powered fitness app built with NodeJS.

- 🏢 Previously, I interned as a Software Developer at SAP in China, where I participated in the development and maintenance of [SAP Work Zone](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/workzone.html), a cloud-based digital workplace that helps employees in an organization communicate and collaborate better.

- 📜 During my undergraduate studies, I worked on research projects related to deep learning in medicine and published a paper titled ["MNL-Network: A Multi-scale Non-local Network for Epilepsy Detection from EEG Signals"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00870/full).

- 💻 My technical interests include distributed systems, networked systems, and artificial intelligence.

- 🌟 In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and exploring new technologies.
